cocosCairo is a 2D application development framework written in Python. You can use it to rapidly construct games or feature-rich user interfaces.

cocosCairo is also an educational tool. Learn more about object-oriented programming in a fun environment!

All of cocosCairo is written in Python, so you can learn advanced systems and user interface designs from perusing the code base. The documentation also links you to the code.

The framework includes a built-in (and optional!) model-view-controller design pattern for creating decoupled code.

Also, since cocosCairo is built on PyGTK and PyCairo, it is also compatible with traditional PyGTK widgets.

TODO:

Set up SVGSprite to be dirtied?

Make Particle system

Make Animation action

Possibly make willEnter, didEnter, willEnterFromFinishedTransition, didEnterFromFinishedTransition, willExit, didExit so users don't have to call super.

Implement double buffering?

Maybe have key press/release events have a list of pressed keys

Look into more intelligent drawing such that only dirtied Nodes are redrawn. Currently all Nodes are redrawn every iteration (except the PangoLabel).

Clean up SystemBlock to use PathNodes.

Clean up SystemDiagram in general to be more legible (no need for list comprehensions or lambda functions).
